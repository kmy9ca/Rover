# Rover

I broke this assignment up into two different files for the two different parts.

Part 1 was done in roverpt1.py. During run-time, the program will prompt for input starting with the upper right coordinates of the plateau (format: x y). For example, if the user entered "3 3" then the grid would have four columns and four rows (Row 0, Row 1, Row 2, Row 3). The program will then prompt for the coordinates and direction of the first rover (format: x y N/S/E/W) along with its path (format: series of "L" "R" "M" characters with no spaces). The path is drawn by the Turtle. Once the user exits the window with the Turtle, the final coordinates and direction of the first Rover are given. The same is done for the second Rover. 

Note: I was not able to get the second turtle running properly. 

Part 2 was done in roverpt2.py. During run-time, the program will prompt for input starting with the upper right coordinates of the plateau (format: x y). The program will then ask for the coordinates and direction of the first and second Rovers respectively in order to calculate a path they can use in order to fully cover the plateau (format: x y N/S/E/W).
